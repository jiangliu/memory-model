//! Traits to access content in memory-alike byte-addressable address spaces.
//!
//! Four abstractions are defined to access content within an address space, which are:
//! - AddressValue: stores the raw value of an address. Typically u32, u64 or usize is used to
//! store the raw value. But pointers, such as *u8, can't be used because it doesn't implement
//! the Add and Sub traits.
//! - Address: encapsulates an AddressValue object and defines methods to access it.
//!
//! To make the abstraction as generic as possible, all the core traits only define methods to
//! access the address space are defined here, and they never define methods to manage (create,
//! delete, insert, remove etc) address spaces.  By this way, the address space consumers
//! (virtio device drivers, vhost drivers and boot loaders etc) may be decoupled from the address
//! space provider (typically a hypervisor).
